Find The Fixed Points — Round 2 (Mains)
======================================

Instructions: Final round is checkpoint-based treasure hunt. 2–3 members per team. The team that reaches final treasure with all clues solved correctly in least time wins.

Structure:
- Multiple checkpoints with riddles/puzzles at each point.
- Teams receive initial clue; solving it reveals next location/clue.
- Organizers verify answers at each checkpoint.

Example Checkpoint Clues:
1) Riddle: "I have keys but open no doors; I have space but no room." (Answer: Keyboard) — leads to computer lab clue station.
2) Numeric: "Take the product of digits of 234 and add 10" — answer leads to next table number.
3) Observation: "Find the poster with blue border in the 2nd corridor and note the third word." — leads to clue code.

Judging:
- Correctness of clue solutions at each checkpoint.
- Total time taken from start to reaching final treasure.
- Penalties for rule violations (e.g., skipping checkpoints) can be applied.

Tie-breaker:
- If teams tie on correctness and time, use a final rapid puzzle round (5 questions) to decide winners.

Organizer notes:
- Prepare printed clue packs, checkpoint volunteers, and verification sheets.
- Ensure safety and access permissions for all checkpoint locations.
